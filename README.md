# **Plotly Challenge**
In this project, an interactive dashboard is built using Plotly to explore and visualize the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The deployed dashboard can be viewed at: https://icode13.github.io/plotly-challenge
